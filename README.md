# My very first web page
Welcome to my first README.md page

## Project Description
This project is a basic three page website. Each page displays logos of various technologies with a link to each one underneath.  
This project shows me how to create and edit files in my workspace on Cloud 9. It shows me how to create a Git repository to store my files and how to send them to my Github account. From my Github account, assessors can view my work and even click on a link to a live version of my project.

### Technologies used
I have used various technologies in this project. I have created HTML files and linked them to a CSS file.  The styles declared in the css file gives my output a more pleasing look. The Divs I created in my html files are styled and positioned thanks to my linked css file.

I then create a Git repository and add all my files to it. This repository keeps all my files together and allows me to view and edit them before sending them to my Github account.  My Github account serves as a back-up of all my project files. It also allows others to view my code and click on a live version of my project.
I Know my files are safe in Github.
